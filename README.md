Greetings! i (try) to code because i like to know how things work,
i also happen to be a bit interested in biology, and the newest
and the most interesting (and perhaps dangerous!) symbiotic "organism" we humans got -
is in fact the computer.
I also believe IT is a careerpath that combines creative and technical thinking in a very stimulating way so id really like 
to get into the industry someday, even if i didnt do well enough this time, ill sure be back ;)
